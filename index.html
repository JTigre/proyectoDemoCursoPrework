        I'm learning GitHub.

    <p>
        Today I am adding a paragraph to my page. As I learn more about htmls and css this will improve
        for now I have to keep up with the course on git and github. 
    </p>

        Today I am adding new paragraph to my page, this is only to practice github. 
        After I finish my course in git and github, I will procced to lear web development and then I will be able to 
        make improvments to this repository and to build a better page. Until then I will keep updating this repo.
